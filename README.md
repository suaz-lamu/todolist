## Project Overview

This project is a part of the Phase 1 submission for the Full Stack Development course. It includes the initial frontend development of a ToDo List web application. The application allows users to add tasks, assign categories, set due dates, associate tasks with projects, and mark tasks as complete or delete them.

The project simulates real-world functionality and provides a foundation to integrate backend features in later phases.
